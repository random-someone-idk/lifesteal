A mod that adds lifesteal mechanics, a bunch of amulets and a new mob! (more planned to be added in the future).

New items:

Player Soul: drops when a player dies, right clicking it increases your health by one heart.
Soul Shard: has a chance to get dropped from mobs, used to craft player souls with 8 of them and a recovery compass.
Amulets: usable in the helmet slot, gives you passive buffs / effects.
New mobs:

Zombie General: a tanky zombie with diamond armor and an iron sword that does high damage and knockback; drops an amulet upon defeat
